// The site glossary. One entry per term.
//
// - `term`: the name shown in the glossary. Keep the official spelling of names and
//   abbreviations (OpenAPI, GraphQL, gRPC, TCP). Start common words with a capital letter
//   (Failover, Exponential backoff).
// - `aliases`: exact spellings to find in articles (case-sensitive). Defaults to [term] plus
//   the same with a lowercase first letter, so "Failover" also finds "failover".
// - `expansion`: what an abbreviation stands for. Only for abbreviations.
// - `short`: one sentence that fits any context. Shown in the tooltip.
// - `explanation`: two or three sentences: what it is and why it matters in a design.
// - `readMore`: where to read more. `href` is a site path (no leading slash, may have `#anchor`)
//   or a full external URL. A page that is the `readMore` of a term explains it in its own text,
//   so the term gets no tooltip on that page.
//
// Write in simple English. Keep `short` and `explanation` true in any context.

		explanation:
			'The server handles the request and returns a response. Client and server are roles: the same component can serve one caller and make requests to another component.',
		readMore: networking('the-app-talks-to-the-server', 'The app talks to the server'),

		id: 'api',
		term: 'API',
		expansion: 'Application Programming Interface',
		short: 'A contract that lets one program use another program.',
		explanation:
			'An API says which requests a program accepts and what it returns. In system design, it usually means the network endpoints that clients and other services call.',

		term: 'HTTP',

		term: 'HTTPS',
		expansion: 'HTTP Secure',
		short: 'HTTP sent over an encrypted TLS connection.',
		explanation:
			'HTTPS is the same HTTP, but TLS encrypts it and proves the server is who it claims to be. Today almost all web traffic uses HTTPS.',
		readMore: networking('agreeing-on-the-format', 'Agreeing on the format'),
	},
	{
		id: 'http-2',
		term: 'HTTP/2',
		short: 'A newer version of HTTP that sends many requests over one connection at the same time.',
		explanation:
			'HTTP/2 splits requests into streams on one TCP connection and compresses headers. A lost TCP packet still stops all streams until it is resent.',
		readMore: networking('agreeing-on-the-format', 'Agreeing on the format'),
	},
	{
		id: 'http-3',
		term: 'HTTP/3',
		short: 'The version of HTTP that runs on QUIC instead of TCP.',

		term: 'TTL',
		expansion: 'Time To Live',
		short: 'How long a piece of data stays valid before it must be refreshed or dropped.',

		id: 'tcp',
		term: 'TCP',
		expansion: 'Transmission Control Protocol',
		short: 'A transport protocol that delivers a reliable, ordered stream of bytes over a connection.',
		explanation:
			'TCP opens a connection with a handshake, numbers every byte, and resends what gets lost. This makes it reliable, but a lost packet delays all data after it. HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and most databases run on TCP.',

		id: 'udp',
		term: 'UDP',
		expansion: 'User Datagram Protocol',
		short: 'A transport protocol that sends separate messages with no delivery or order guarantees.',
		explanation:
			'UDP has no connection and no resends, so it adds very little delay. The application must handle loss and order itself if it cares. Live audio, video, games, and QUIC use UDP.',

		id: 'quic',
		term: 'QUIC',
		short: 'A transport protocol on top of UDP that gives reliable streams with built-in encryption.',

		expansion: 'Transport Layer Security',
		short: 'The protocol that encrypts a connection and proves the server is who it claims to be.',

		term: 'Round trip',
		aliases: ['round trip', 'round trips', 'Round trip'],
		short: 'The time for a message to reach the other side and for the answer to come back.',

		short: 'An API style where the client sends a query that names exactly the fields it needs.',
