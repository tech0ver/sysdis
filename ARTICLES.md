# ARTICLES.md

The map of articles on this site: written and planned. Use it to decide which article a topic belongs to and to link articles to each other.

An article covers its own topic in depth. When another article needs that topic, it says one line about it and links here instead of explaining it again.

## Links to articles that do not exist yet

Put a hidden marker where the link should go. The marker is an HTML comment, so the site does not show it:

```md
Real-time systems route messages between servers for this. <!-- link: patterns/real-time -->
```

The value is the page path under `src/content/docs/`, without the extension. Use the paths from this file.

When you write an article, find the markers that point to it and turn them into relative links:

```sh
grep -rn "link: patterns/real-time" src/content/docs
```

Then add links from the new article to the existing ones, and update `readMore` in the glossary for the terms the new article explains.

## Sections

- **Fundamentals** — the computer science under system design: concepts and trade-offs that every design uses, with no specific products. Once a fundamental article exists, the topic grows only through patterns and technologies.
- **Patterns** — reusable solutions built from the fundamentals: how to solve a typical problem in a design.
- **Technologies** — specific tools and products, and how they implement the fundamentals.

## Fundamentals

Listed in the planned reading order. Each article tells the story of one system as it grows, where each solution brings the next problem, and ends with the problem the next article solves.

- `fundamentals/networking` — How components talk over a network: client and server, IP and DNS, TCP and UDP, TLS, HTTP, pushing updates, load balancing, stateless servers, regions and CDN, failed calls.
- `fundamentals/storage-engines` — How one node stores and finds data, built up from a plain file: append-only log, hash index, segments and compaction, crash recovery, SSTable and LSM-tree, Bloom filters, B-tree, write-ahead log, secondary and composite indexes and their cost, row and column storage, OLTP and OLAP. No concurrent access here.
- `fundamentals/databases` — What shape to give data and where to keep it: relational, document, key-value, wide-column, graph, and time-series models; schema, normalization and denormalization; designing from access patterns; object storage for files; search indexes; using several databases at once. Ends where one machine is not enough.
- `fundamentals/transactions` — Keeping data correct under concurrent access and crashes on one node: lost updates, atomic operations, ACID, isolation levels and their anomalies, snapshot isolation and MVCC, write skew, optimistic and pessimistic locking.
- `fundamentals/replication` — Copies of data across nodes and regions: leader and followers, multi-leader, leaderless and quorums, replication lag, stale reads, eventual consistency, read-your-writes and monotonic reads, failover.
- `fundamentals/sharding` — Splitting data across nodes: shard keys, range and hash partitioning, consistent hashing, hot shards, rebalancing, secondary indexes across shards.
- `fundamentals/consistency` — How nodes agree: consistency models from linearizable (strong) to causal and eventual, CAP and PACELC, time and ordering of events, consensus (Raft), leader election, distributed transactions (2PC, saga).
- `fundamentals/caching` — Where to cache, cache-aside and write-through, HTTP caching (Cache-Control, ETag), invalidation, eviction, hot keys, cache stampede.
- `fundamentals/async-communication` — Decoupling components in time: queues and logs, pub/sub, delivery guarantees (at-most-once, at-least-once, exactly-once), idempotent consumers, ordering, back-pressure.
- `fundamentals/failures` — Keeping the whole system up: partial failures, failure detection, redundancy and failover, availability math, blast radius, graceful degradation. A single failed call (timeouts, retries, idempotency keys) is in networking.
- `fundamentals/security` — Authentication and authorization, CORS, cookies, mTLS, where to end TLS, secrets.
- `fundamentals/observability` — Metrics, logs, traces, SLOs and alerts.
- `fundamentals/requirements` — Framing a design: functional and non-functional requirements, latency and throughput, percentiles, availability in nines, SLOs, back-of-the-envelope estimates, the numbers to remember (memory, disk, network round trips). Written last, when the other articles exist to link to.

### Three meanings of "consistency"

The word means different things in different articles. Each article says which one it uses and links to the others.

- The C in ACID: data follows its rules, for example a balance never goes below zero. In `fundamentals/transactions`.
- Isolation: concurrent transactions do not see each other's half-done work. In `fundamentals/transactions`.
- Consistency between copies: strong or eventual. `fundamentals/replication` shows how replication lag causes eventual consistency; `fundamentals/consistency` covers the full range of models and how to get strong consistency.

## Patterns

- `patterns/resilience` — Circuit breaker, bulkhead, retry budget, load shedding, cascading failures.
- `patterns/rate-limiting` — Limiting algorithms, limits across many servers, the "design a rate limiter" task.
- `patterns/real-time` — Long-lived connections at scale: routing messages between servers, reconnect and replay, heartbeats, slow clients, presence.
- `patterns/api-gateway` — One entry point for clients: API gateway, BFF, auth, routing, response composition.
- `patterns/service-discovery` — Service registry, client-side load balancing, service mesh.
- `patterns/async-messaging` — Queues in a design: 202 Accepted and background work, transactional outbox, fan-out.

## Technologies

- `technologies/api-styles` — REST, gRPC, GraphQL; HTTP methods, status codes, idempotent methods.
- `technologies/load-balancers` — Forward and reverse proxies, balancing algorithms in depth, sticky sessions, hash routing, connection draining; NGINX, Envoy, HAProxy.
- `technologies/cdn` — How a CDN works, anycast routing to a nearby edge, what to cache on it, invalidation.
- `technologies/webrtc` — How WebRTC connects peers: NAT, STUN, TURN, signaling.
