# Write an article

This skill is the process. [WRITING.md](../../../WRITING.md) is the standard the result must meet. Read WRITING.md first, then follow the steps in order. Do not skip the approvals in steps 3 and 4.

The article is written together with the author, block by block. The author's feedback on each block is the main source of quality: expect several rounds and keep every rule they give you.

Keep working notes in `.agents/<article-slug>/` (git-ignored): `sources.md`, `plan.md`, review files, and backups of replaced files. They let a later session continue the work. Log decisions and progress in `plan.md` as you go.

## 1. Agree on the scope

Ask the author, or confirm from the request:

- The topic and the target page (new file, or an existing one to rewrite).
- The sources for this article: study notes (for example Notion pages), books, sites, the author's own experience. Other interview prep sites only show what to cover.
- Anything that must be in the article, or must stay out.

Read [ARTICLES.md](../../../ARTICLES.md): it says which topics belong to this article and which belong to others. If the author gives no sources, propose some and wait for an answer.

## 2. Collect from the sources

- Read every source the author named. If a source has its own reading guide (for example an instructions page in a notes workspace), follow it.
- Write the facts to `sources.md`, grouped by subtopic, with the source of each fact.
- Keep facts that change a design decision: a default choice, a signal to pick something else, a trade-off, a number, a common mistake. Drop internals, history, and "why it exists".
- List conflicts between sources and open questions separately.

## 3. Plan the story and get approval

Write `plan.md` before any prose:

- **Running example.** One compact system that naturally runs into every problem of the topic, and why it fits.
- **Story.** The blocks in order, one line each: the problem the example meets, the solutions, and the next problem it leads to. Each block becomes a `##` section.
- **Scope.** What is in, what is out and why, and which article in ARTICLES.md gets each boundary topic.
- **Open questions** from step 2.

Show the plan to the author and wait for approval. Add new planned articles to ARTICLES.md.

## 4. Write block by block

- Write the first blocks one at a time, and later ones in groups of two or three; a disputed block goes alone.
- Before showing a block: run the `humanizer` skill on it (if a suggestion breaks WRITING.md, WRITING.md wins), run `bun run build`, and check the page in a preview.
- Wait for the author's feedback and fix the block before moving on.
- Every style remark from the author becomes a rule in `plan.md`. If the rule applies to any article, add it to WRITING.md too.
- Check claims against the sources. When the author questions a fact, check the sources before answering.
- Where a topic belongs to another article, write one line and put a hidden link marker (see WRITING.md, "Other articles").

## 5. Finish the text

1. **Intro and cheat sheet.** Write them after all blocks are approved (WRITING.md, "Article shape").
2. **Glossary pass.** Add missing terms, point `readMore` of the terms this article explains to its sections, fix entries that disagree with the text, remove unused ones. Then check the built page: each tooltip must be on a first mention, and no term the page explains may have one. Delete `node_modules/.astro/data-store.json` before the build, or the page keeps old tooltips.
3. **External review.** Ask a reviewer with fresh context (a subagent, or another model in a separate thread) to check accuracy, story, interview value, and language, and to answer for each block: what to pick by default and when to pick something else. Triage every finding with the author (apply, soften, defer to another article, or reject) and show the triage before you apply anything. A second round checks the fixes.

## 6. Diagrams

1. Read the whole article and propose where diagrams help: what each one shows (a difference, an evolution, or how something works) and why. Agree on the list with the author.
2. Draw one diagram as a style sample and get the author's approval before drawing the rest. The `diagram-design` skill helps with layout, but the result must follow WRITING.md, "Diagrams": an SVG in `src/diagrams/` with `dg-*` classes, not a standalone HTML file.
3. Check every diagram in both themes and at phone width (take screenshots of the built page), then show them to the author.
4. Before showing the set, check that all diagrams follow the same rules, especially the accent.

## 7. Link the articles

- Find markers that point to this article and turn them into relative links: `grep -rn "link: <this-article-path>" src/content/docs`.
- Link from this article to existing articles instead of leaving markers for them.
- Point `readMore` of the terms this article explains to its sections.
- Mark the article as written in ARTICLES.md.

## 8. Hand over

Tell the author what changed, which open questions are left, and how to view the page with `bun run dev`. Then follow the change workflow in AGENTS.md.
